I had a contract with Mr. X regarding sale of cattle. But during the formation of the
 contract, a term in the contract that states that one of the contractors should commit
  suicide if the party fails to perform the obligations under the contract. Afterwards, 
  Mr. X was declared bankrupt and he unalived himself. So, what will be the fate of the 
  contract? and how is the legality of the object of the contract viewed under Ethiopian 
  contract law
